平权数十年，职场女性地位上升遭遇天花板

在3月8日国际妇女节这一天，《经济学人》公布了最新的“玻璃天花板指数”，该指数跟踪并分析了发达国家女性在职场上的状况，以探讨她们在哪里最能获得平等对待。数据表明，近些年女性在职场中的地位并没有太大改善。但好的方面是，北欧国家在帮助女性完成大学教育并找到工作等方面表现非常突出。而反观亚洲一些国家的表现却并不尽如人意，很多亚洲女性压力巨大，往往既要顾及家庭，又要在职场中与男性竞争。

Today is International Women's Day.
After decades of improvement, progress for women in the workplace has recently stalled.
The Economist's latest glass-ceiling index tracks where women have the best chance of equal treatment at work within the rich world.
It finds that the gender pay gap is stuck at around 14%, women's share of management jobs remains at 32% and labour-force participation has barely budged.
There are bright spots.
Nordic countries are particularly good at helping women complete university and secure a job.
They also offer supportive parental leave, while mandatory quotas for women on boards have boosted representation.
Asia, with stubborn societal norms, fares worst.
In Japan and South Korea, the division of labour at home is woefully unbalanced: women do five times more housework than men.
Many must choose between a family and a career.
Women who choose to work often struggle to secure top jobs; men are typically favoured for promotions.
