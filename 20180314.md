3月10日，埃塞俄比亚航空公司302号航班在该国首都亚的斯亚贝巴附近坠毁，机上149名乘客和8名机组人员无人生还，其中包括8名中国公民。截止到3月11日，ET302的两个黑匣子——驾驶舱语音记录仪和飞行数据记录器都已找到，但数据解码还未公布。这是四个多月来第二架同机型坠毁，目前包括中国、埃塞俄比亚、印尼、新加坡、阿根廷在内的多个国家都宣布停飞波音737 MAX-8，波音公司面临信任危机。

## Ethiopian flight 302: second new Boeing 737 to crash in four months

An Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed on Sunday near Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people on board.

Few details about the crash are yet available.

The Boeing 737 MAX 8, a brand new plane only registered in November, disappeared from the radar six minutes into the flight.

Immediate comparisons have been drawn with Lion Air flight 610, also a MAX 8, which crashed just over four months ago.

Boeing 737-MAX is the latest iteration of the 737, the world's bestselling plane, ever more capable of flying autonomously.

The new plane automatically compensates if it believes its angle puts it at a risk of stalling.

Autonomy, however, can bring problems.

It is notable that insurers considering driverless cars worry most about the period when highly autonomous vehicles will coexist with human drivers, the uncertain interface between human and artificial intelligence.

Boeing argued that if pilots followed existing procedures, there should be no danger.

Past crashes, however, have shown that the sensors on which aircraft computer systems rely can malfunction, and that pilots who have grown to trust the technology can become rapidly bewildered when things go wrong.

All too human reactions led to disaster.
